# System Elaboration
#### ECE M202A Project: UWB Indoor Positioning - Select & Control
Contribute: Jiacheng Liu, Yibo Wang

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     This System elaboration part is created due to the hardware limitation and time constraints. During the development period of this project, we went through some prior works and researches. And as we became more familiar with the topic, we had come up with some thoughts about other configurations of the system to achieve device pointing/selection and control. So we would like to also elaborate on these ideas even though we are not able to accomplish them due to hardware and time constraints.  

### System Elaboration 1: UWB pointing algorithm with pointing action detection

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### System Elaboration 2: Improve UWB pointing with depth camera embedded

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### System Elaboration 3: Pointing system with trace tracking for motion radius calculation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### System Elaboration 4: UWB robustness improvement with IMU sensor fusion

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### System Elaboration 5: UWB poinitng assist wireless data transmission
